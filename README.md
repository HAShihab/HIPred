# HIPred

HIPred scores for each gene in the human genome are listed in <i>HIPred.tsv</i>.

### Interpretation

Predictions are in the range [0, 1]: values above 0.5 are predicted to be <b><i>haploinsufficient</b></i>, while those below 0.5 are predicted to be <b><i>haplosufficient</b></i>.  Scores close to the extremes are the highest-confidence predictions that yield the highest accuracy.
